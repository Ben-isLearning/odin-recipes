    <h2> A tasty Lasanga shared by Debbie (/cook/3863452/) </h2>

    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <p>9 lasagna noodles <br>
        ¼ cup margarine  <br>
        ¼ cup all-purpose flour  <br>
        ½ teaspoon salt  <br>
        ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper  <br>
        1 cup milk  <br>
        ½ cup vegetable broth, or as needed  <br>
        2 tablespoons white wine  <br>
        ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese  <br>
        1 cup light ricotta cheese <br> 
        1 egg <br> 
        1 egg white  <br>
        1 tablespoon olive oil  <br>
        2 cups coarsely shredded carrots  <br>
        2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini  <br>
        1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained  <br>
        1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  <br>
     </p>

     <h4> Steps</h4>
     <p>  Step 1<br>

        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
         </p>
     <p>  Step 2<br>

        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </p>
     <p>  Step 3<br>

        Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
        </p>
     <p> Step 4<br>

        Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
         </p>
     <p> Step 5<br>

        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
        </p>
     <p>  Step 6<br>

        Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
        </p>

        <p>  Step 7<br>

            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
            </p>
